Arrays and the ArrayList are both used to store multiple elements. They differ in structure, flexibility, and performance, however. An array is a fixed-size linear data structure that stores elements of the same data type. It allows access to individual elements by an index. It cannot, however, change its size once it has been declared. Arrays can hold both primitive types (like int, double, or char) and objects. ArrayList forms part of the Java Collections Framework. It is an actual implementation of a resizable array. It grows and shrinks along with the addition and removal of elements, respectively, making it more flexible. However, it can store only objects; thus, in place of primitive values, their respective wrapper classes must be used (for example, Integer for int).&nbsp;
Size differentials between Array and ArrayList are starkly different as the former is of a fixed size and the latter dynamically resizes.
In respect to performance: Being of a fixed size, arrays perform better in terms of speed since they do not require juggling with resizing or with the various methods.
Maneuverability of elements: Normally, for inserting elements into or deleting elements from an array, one must shift the remaining elements. In ArrayLists, one can shift elements or add and remove elements using built-in methods like add() and remove().
Data storage: While arrays can store both primitive and object types, ArrayList is rather limited in the sense that it can store only objects.&nbsp;
